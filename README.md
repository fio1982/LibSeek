# LibSeek

LibSeek is an open-source prototype software which can be used for recommending potential useful third-party libraries for mobile app development. The most significant characteristic of it is that, it can not only effectively give out the recommendation list, but only diversity the prediction result, which can bring more benefit for developers.

LibSeek employs an adaptive weighting mechanism to neutralize the bias caused by the popularity of third-party libraries. In addition, it introduces neighborhood information, i.e., information about similar apps and similar third-party libraries, to personalize the predictions for individual apps.

# How to use

This prototype is made via Matlab, thus please download the source script and open it with Matlab. It has been tested under Matlab 2017b, however, older or newer version should be fine to execute it.
